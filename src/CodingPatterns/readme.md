## 1 Sliding Window

Usage: This algorithmic technique is used when we need to handle the input data in a specific
window size.

DS Involved: Array, String, HashTable

Sample Problems:
-  Longest Substring with 'K' Distinct Characters
- Fruits into Baskets

## 2 Islands (Matrix Traversal) 

Usage: This pattern describes all the efficient
ways of traversing a matrix (or 2D array).

DS Involved: Matrix, Queue

Sample Problems:
- Number of Islands
- Flood Fill
- Cycle in a Matrix

## 3 Two Pointers 

Usage: This technique uses two pointers to iterate input data. Generally, both pointers move in the opposite direction at a constant
interval.

DS Involved: Array, String, LinkedList

Sample Problems:
- Squaring a Sorted Array
- Dutch National Flag Problem
- Minimum Window Sort

## 4 Fast & Slow Pointers 

Usage: Also known as Hare & Tortoise algorithm. This technique uses two pointers
that traverse the input data at different speeds.

DS Involved: Array, String, LinkedList

Sample Problems:
- Middle of the LinkedList
- Happy Number
- Cycle in a Circular Array

## 5 Merge Intervals

Usage: This technique is used to deal with
overlapping intervals.

DS Involved: Array, Heap

Sample Problems:
- Conflicting Appointments
- Minimum Meeting Rooms

## 6 Cyclic Sort 

Usage: Use this technique to solve array problems where the input data lies within a
fixed range.

DS Involved: Array

Sample Problems:
- Find all Missing Numbers
- Find all Duplicate Numbers
- Find the First K Missing Positive Numbers

## 7 In-place Reversal of a LinkedList 

Usage: This technique describes an efficient way to reverse the links between a set of nodes of a LinkedList. Often, the constraint is that we need to do this in-place, i.e., using the existing
node objects and without using extra memory.

DS Involved: Array

Sample Problems:
- Reverse every K-element Sub-list
- Rotate a LinkedList

## 8 Breadth-First Search 

Usage: This technique is used to solve problems involving traversing trees or graphs in
a breadth-first search manner.

DS Involved: Tree, Graph, Matrix, Queue

Sample Problems:
- Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
- Minimum Depth of a Binary Tree
- Connect Level Order Siblings

## 9 Tree Depth First Search 

Usage: This technique is used to solve problems involving traversing trees or graphs in
a depth-first search manner.

DS Involved: Tree, Graph, Matrix

Sample Problems:
- Path With Given Sequence
- Count Paths for a Sum

## 10 Two Heaps 

Usage: In many problems, we are given a set of elements that can be divided into two parts. We are interested in knowing the smallest element in one part and the biggest element in the other part. As the name suggests, this technique uses a Min-Heap to find the smallest element and a
Max-Heap to find the biggest element.

DS Involved: Heap, Array

Sample Problems:
- Find the Median of a Number Stream
- Next Interval

## 11 Subsets 

Usage: Use this technique when the problem asks to deal with permutations or combinations
of a set of elements.

DS Involved: Queue, Array, String

Sample Problems:
- String Permutations by changing case
- Unique Generalized Abbreviations

## 12 Modified Binary Search 

Usage: Use this technique to search a sorted
set of elements efficiently.

DS Involved: Array

Sample Problems:
- Ceiling of a Number
- Bitonic Array Maximum

## 13 Bitwise XOR 

Usage: This technique uses the XOR operator
to manipulate bits to solve problems.

DS Involved: Array, Bits

Sample Problems:
- Two Single Numbers
- Flip and Invert an Image

## 14 Top 'K' Elements 

Usage: This technique is used to find
top/smallest/frequently occurring 'K' elements in
a set.

DS Involved: Array, Heap, Queue

Sample Problems:
- 'K' Closest Points to the Origin
- Maximum Distinct Elements

## 15 K-way Merge 

Usage: This technique helps us solve problems
that involve a list of sorted arrays.

DS Involved: Array, Queue, Heap

Sample Problems:
- Kth Smallest Number in M Sorted Lists
- Kth Smallest Number in a Sorted Matrix

## 16 Topological Sort 

Usage: Use this technique to find a linear ordering of elements that have dependencies
on each other.

DS Involved: Array, HashTable, Queue

Sample Problems:
- Tasks Scheduling
- Alien Dictionary

## 17 0/1 Knapsack 

Usage: This technique is used to solve optimization problems. Use this technique to select elements that give maximum profit from a given set with a limitation on capacity and that
each element can only be picked once.

DS Involved: Array, HashTable

Sample Problems:
- Equal Subset Sum Partition
- Minimum Subset Sum Difference

## 18 Fibonacci Numbers 

Usage: Use this technique to solve problems that follow the Fibonacci numbers sequence, i.e., every subsequent number is calculated
from the last few numbers.

DS Involved: Array, HashTable

Sample Problems
- Staircase
- House Thief

## 19 Palindromic Subsequence 

Usage: This technique is used to solve optimization problems related to palindromic
sequences or strings.

DS Involved: Array, HashTable

Sample Problems:
- Longest Palindromic Subsequence
- Minimum Deletions in a String to make it a
Palindrome

## 20 Longest Common Substring 

Usage: Use this technique to find the optimal part of a string/sequence or set of
strings/sequences.

DS Involved: Array, HashTable

Sample Problems:
- Maximum Sum Increasing Subsequence
- Edit Distance
